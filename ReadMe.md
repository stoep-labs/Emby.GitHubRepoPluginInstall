## Configuration

### GitHub Personal Access Token Setup
You need to create a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) to use this plugin:

## Creating Your Own Plugin Registry

You can host your own `plugins.json` file and share it with others:

### 1. Create the JSON File

Create a `plugins.json` file with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "My Plugin Registry",
  "description": "Custom collection of Emby plugins",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "My Awesome Plugin",
      "description": "Does something awesome for Emby",
      "url": "https://github.com/username/my-awesome-plugin"
    },
    {
      "name": "Another Great Plugin", 
      "description": "Another useful Emby plugin",
      "url": "https://github.com/username/another-plugin"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Host the File

#### Option A: GitHub Repository (Recommended)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `my-emby-plugins`)
2. Add your `plugins.json` file to the repository
3. Get the raw URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/my-emby-plugins/main/plugins.json`

#### Option B: GitHub Gist
1. Create a public GitHub Gist
2. Add your `plugins.json` file
3. Get the raw URL from the Gist

#### Option C: Other Hosting
Any publicly accessible URL that returns the JSON file will work (your own web server, cloud storage, etc.)

### 3. Share Your Registry

Share the raw URL with others. They can add it by:
1. Going to the plugin configuration page
2. Clicking "Add Registry" 
3. Entering your registry name and the raw URL
4. Enabling the registry

### Registry Best Practices
- ✅ **Test URLs**: Ensure all plugin repository URLs are valid and accessible
- ✅ **Clear Descriptions**: Write helpful descriptions for each plugin
- ✅ **Keep Updated**: Regularly review and update your plugin list
- ✅ **Use HTTPS**: Always use secure URLs for better reliability
- ✅ **Validate JSON**: Ensure your JSON file is properly formatted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check your GitHub token has the correct scopes
- **404 Not Found**: Verify repository exists and token has access (for private repos)
- **No DLL Assets**: Plugin releases must contain .DLL files to be installable
- **Registry Not Loading**: Verify the registry URL returns valid JSON
